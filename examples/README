This directory contains examples demonstrating the use of the Perl LSID
Client/Server stack.

Two example authorities are provided, i3c_authority is much simpler for
a novice to understand. hugo_authority uses a MySQL database backend and
dynamically generates metadata from it.




client/ - A simple example client that will resolve and LSID.

assigning/ - A sample LSID Assigning Service Client and Server

tools/ - A collection of files to help in developing your own services

i3c_authority/ - A simple file based authority for the i3c LSIDs. This uses the new
                 authority framework.

hugo_authority/ - A database driven authority example. This uses the new authority
                  framework as well as the RDF::SimpleDocument object to return 
                  metadata dynamically generated from the database.

http_metadata/ - A HTTP/CGI metadata service implementation of the simple i3c.org authority. 
		 This is an external metadata service as opposed to the internal services in
		 the other example authorities.

proxy_resolver/ - An implementation of an LSID Resolver that accepts ANY LSID and attempts
		  to proxy the request between the client and actual authority.

webresolver/ - A web form based LSID resolution service

designer/ - A web form based authority generation service

configs/ - Contains example configuration files for the client


compatibility/ - The simple LSID authority using the old (but still usable)
                 direct calls in to the LSID stack
